## Pages buttons and content boxes that reflect the following: Cars with bright lights cutting through tightly packed buildings.  Buildings illuminated with various lights. Everything held together with a purple night sky. 

## More Detail
- Possibly create a backround that is like a street light that radiates a white light and has a radial gradient into a purple night sky.
- Possibly create borders that are bright like car lights driving around city streets
- Content containers that are dark like steel or concrete illumintaed with bright windows (words) of varying colors.
- I need a font that reflects a city street at night but that is also big enough to clearly read with different colors.

## All primary components
- Like a melting pot of stylish people walking the streets with mohawks, tattoos, ripped jeans and leather shoes. Where punk meets business.
- Buttons could be made with icons or designs like tattoos on light backgrounds, legible text with little designs surrounding them.
